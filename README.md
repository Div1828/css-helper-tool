# CSS Helper Tool

A modern, intuitive, and responsive CSS utility generator built with React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. The app provides an interactive playground to visually design and preview CSS styles, then instantly extract clean Tailwind or vanilla CSS code.

This tool is perfect for developers, designers, or students looking to speed up UI development without memorizing class names or writing redundant style code.
